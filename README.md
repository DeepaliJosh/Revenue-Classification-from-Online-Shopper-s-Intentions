# Revenue Classification using Online Shopper's Intention

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Revenue Classification using Online Shopper's Intention" project! This repository hosts a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning initiative, aimed at predicting the likelihood of online shoppers generating revenue for an e-commerce website. By analyzing a variety of features related to online shopping behavior, we endeavor to construct a classification model capable of determining whether a visitor will make a purchase or not. The primary phases of this project include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Our journey begins with data preprocessing. We meticulously clean and preprocess the dataset, addressing issues such as missing values and data quality to ensure we have reliable input data for our analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this phase, we dive deep into the dataset. Our objective is to gain profound insights into the data, comprehend the distribution of critical variables, and pinpoint noteworthy patterns or trends in online shopping behavior. EDA plays a pivotal role in understanding the characteristics of our data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Features are the building blocks of any machine learning model. We craft meaningful features from the dataset that will serve as the foundation for our revenue classification. This process may involve data transformation and the careful selection of relevant features to enhance model performance.

4. **Data Visualization**: Data visualization is a powerful tool in our toolkit. We employ various charts and graphs to visually represent relationships between different features and the likelihood of revenue generation. Visualizations help us communicate insights effectively.

5. **Model Selection and Training**: With our data well-prepared and features engineered, we proceed to select and train classification models. This includes exploring algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or any other suitable models that can accurately predict revenue generation based on our selected features.

6. **Model Evaluation**: The success of our project is gauged through rigorous model evaluation. We employ appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess the performance of our models. Effective model evaluation ensures that our predictions are reliable.
